## 2.1 Introduction

This chapter runs through the development of a small toy package. It’s meant to paint the Big Picture and suggest a workflow, before we descend into the detailed treatment of the key components of an R package.

## 2.2 Load devtools and friends

Load the `devtools` package, which is the public face of a set of packages that support various aspects of package development. The most obvious of these is the `usethis` package, which you’ll see is also being loaded.

```{r Load the devtools package}

library(devtools)

```

Check the version of devtools that is on my computer, see if it's the same as the author's version:

```{r Check version of devtools on my computer}

packageVersion("devtools")

```

I'm using devtools version 2.4.5, and that's the same as the author's version.

## 2.3 Toy package: regexcite
