## 3.1 Prepare your system

To get started, make sure you have the latest version of R (at least 4.2.2, which is the version being used to render this book), then run the following code to get the packages youâ€™ll need:

```{r}
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
```

```{r}

devtools::dev_sitrep()

```
